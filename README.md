# Atla Mock Monorepo

Welcome! This is a mock repository designed for teaching **GitHub Workflows**.

It simulates a "monorepo" (a single repository containing multiple projects) with three simple services.

## Services

| Service                                | Language   | Description                                          |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **[python-api](services/python-api/)** | Python     | Simulates a backend API returning user data.         |
| **[js-web](services/js-web/)**         | JavaScript | Simulates a frontend web page rendering a dashboard. |
| **[go-worker](services/go-worker/)**   | Go         | Simulates a background worker processing tasks.      |

## Goal

The code here is intentionally simple. The goal is not to learn complex programming, but to practice:

1. Cloning a repository
2. Creating branches
3. Committing code
4. Opening Pull Requests (PRs)
5. Reviewing code

## Getting Started

Please read the [Git Workflow Guide](docs/git-workflow.md) to learn how to contribute.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/)

(You only need to install the language for the service you want to touch).
